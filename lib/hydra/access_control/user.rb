# Injects behaviors into User model so that it will work with Hydra Access Controls
# By default, this module assumes you are using the User model created by Blacklight, which uses Devise.
# To integrate your own User implementation into Hydra, override this Module or define your own User model in app/models/user.rb within your Hydra head.

  def self.included(klass)

  # This method should display the unique identifier for this user
  # the unique identifier is what access controls will be enforced against. 
  def unique_id
